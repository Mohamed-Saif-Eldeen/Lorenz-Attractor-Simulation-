# Lorenz Attractor Simulation
This project is a Python-based simulation of the Lorenz Attractor, which is a classic example of a chaotic system. The simulation uses numerical methods to solve the system of ordinary differential equations that describe the attractor's behavior. It provides an interactive visualization of the attractor's trajectory and allows users to explore the effects of different parameters on its dynamics.

# Features
+ Numerical integration of the Lorenz equations using a Runge-Kutta method.
+ Interactive controls to adjust simulation parameters and observe their impact.
+ Real-time visualization of the attractor's trajectory in a 3D plot.
+ Adjustable animation speed for dynamic exploration.
+ Slider controls for varying system parameters.

# Requirements
+ Python 3.x
+ NumPy
+ Matplotlib

# Usage
1. Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
2. Run the simulation script: python lorenz_attractor.py.
3. Use the sliders to adjust the simulation parameters and observe the changes in real-time.
4. Explore the dynamics of the Lorenz Attractor by interacting with the 3D plot.
